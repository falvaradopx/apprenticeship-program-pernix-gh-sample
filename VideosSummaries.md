**Who Moved My Cheese:**
We should never stop looking for cheese. Once we find it, we need to plan how to use and consume it properly. Also, we should always have our shoes on and keep searching for new cheese reserves. That way, when one stock runs out, we will have another backup to survive. The video talks about the importance of not having a conformist mind, not just sitting and eating the cheese without a backup plan in case it runs out. This means in life we should always pursue our dreams, and once we achieve them, we must keep fighting to maintain them or even pursue new ones. We should never sit and wait for the cheese to come back or magically appear.

**Milgram Experiment:**
What I find interesting in the video is how it shows the little autonomy people have, especially when they are following orders or instructions from superiors, or in the case of the experiment, someone in a white coat. People would even administer a lethal electric shock to another person, even though they were fully aware of what they were doing, just by following the experimenter's instructions.

**Use Your Body Language to Rock Your Presentation:**
The video highlights four important points to improve your body language:
- **Approach with an eyebrow flash:** It explains the importance of the upper part of the face, like the eyes and eyebrows, and how they help connect with the audience.
- **Win with the right smile:** It talks about how a real smile helps in connecting with people.
- **Steeple for success:** This focuses on the power of hand gestures.
- **Move to keep their attention:** This explains the importance of movement during a presentation to maintain audience engagement.

**Why You Should Let Your Workers Rebel:**
The video talks about the importance of allowing employees to be non-conformists in organizations because conformity limits innovation and performance. The main problem is that companies often pressure workers to fit into the status quo, which reduces their authenticity and creativity. The solution is to promote "constructive non-conformity," which means allowing employees to stray from the norms in a way that benefits the organization. "Rebels" are those who feel comfortable challenging the system, bringing benefits like greater commitment and performance. Gino emphasizes the importance of authenticity and how it strengthens employees, improving innovation and performance. To encourage this behavior, leaders should give employees the freedom to be themselves, provide space for solving problems independently, and challenge established norms.
